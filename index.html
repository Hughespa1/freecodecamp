    <h3 id="headline">Here's few facts about Albert Einsteins life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Einstein is known for his theory of general relativity (an explanation of gravity), and the photoelectric effect (which explains the behavior of electrons under certain circumstances); his work on the latter earned him a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.</li>
      <li>Einstein tried in vain to unify all the forces of the universe in a single theory, or a theory of everything, which he was still working on at the time of his death.</li>
      <li>Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany, a town that today has a population of just more than 120,000.</li>
      <li>Einstein's father, Hermann, ran an electrochemical factory and his mother Pauline took care of Albert and his younger sister, Maria.</li>
      <li>The second wonder came at age 12 when he discovered a book of geometry, which he worshipped, calling it his "holy geometry book."</li>
      <li>Einstein rebelled against the authoritarian attitude of some of his teachers and dropped out of school at 16.</li>
      <li>He later took an entrance exam for the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich, and while his performances in physics and math were excellent, his marks in other areas were subpar, and he did not pass the exam.</li>
      <li>The aspiring physicist took additional courses to close the gap in his knowledge, and was admitted to Swiss Polytechnic in 1896, and in 1901 received his diploma to teach physics and mathematics.</li>
      <li>Einstein married Mileva Maric, a longtime love of his from Zurich, in 1903. Their children, Hans Albert and Eduard, were born in 1904 and 1910. (The fate of a child born to them in 1902 before their marriage, Lieserl, is unknown.) Einstein divorced Maric in 1919 and soon after married Elsa Löwenthal. Löwenthal died in 1933.</li>
      <li>After suffering an abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture several days before, Albert Einstein died on April 18, 1955, at age 76.</li>
    </ul>
